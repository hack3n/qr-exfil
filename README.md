<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Do you have RDP or VDI access, but no copy/paste, no outbound network, and need to exfiltrate some sensitive data? 
This tool provides a method to reliably move files from restricted environments such as these to your own machine.
It's web-based, circumventing client-side security controls such as AV/EDR or application control, and usually performant enough to transfer moderately large files (50MB) in a reasonable amount of time (a few hours).

### Installation

Run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hack3n/qr-exfil
pip3 install pyzbar pillow pybase64 opencv-python
```

What you need:
 - Some kind of desktop session on a remote machine
 - A Flipper or a rubber ducky USB

If you need to transfer files from a restricted physical machine as well:
 - A laptop to receive
 - USB video capture card
 - HDMI cable

### Usage

Basic usage:
 - Prepare `qr-exfil.html` to display QR codes on your primary monitor, either within your remote session (RDP or VDI), or using a USB video capture card and displaying the camera on screen.
 - Run `reader.py` on your host.
 - Start the QR code output on the target.
 - Wait for it to complete, then exit with `CTRL + C`.
 - Use the `util\dump-from-json.py` script to get your output file on your host.

This repository includes a number of scripts and utilities that you may require:
 - `reader.py` - Reads your primary moniter for QR codes and dumps them to a `raw.json` file.
 - `qr-exfil.html` - The payload HTML that chunks and displays a local file in rotating QR codes.
 - `util\dump-from-json.py` - Reads the raw data from `raw.json` and outputs it to a file `output`.
 - `util\find-missing-ids.py` - Reads `raw.json` and checks that no chunks were missed by the reader.
 - `util\make-ducky.py` - Converts `qr-exfil.html` into a ruber ducky script payload to infil into your target environment.
 - `util\make-ducky-hex-string.py` - Sometimes VDI's can be sensitive with capital letters and special characters, so same as above, but as hex.
 - `util\decode-hex.html` - Intended to be manually typed out on the target environment to decode the hex inserted by the above script.
